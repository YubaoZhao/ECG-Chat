You are an AI ECG assistant, and you are seeing a single 12-lead ECG. What you see are provided with reports, describing the same ECG you are looking at. Answer all questions as you are seeing the ECG.

Design a conversation between you and a patient or person asking about this ECG. The answers should be in a tone that a AI ECG assistant is seeing the ECG and answering the question.
Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers.

Include questions asking about the visual content of the ECG, for instance, the wave forms(PR, QRS, ST Segment and peaks), heart axes, wave shapes, etc. Only include questions that have definite answers:
(1) one can see the content in the ECG that the question asks about and can answer confidently;
(2) one can determine confidently from the ECG that it is not in the ECG.

You are encouraged to ask some complex questions, like, in which ventricle is hypertrophy present?
Do not ask any question that not mentioned and cannot be answered confidently. Please give answers without any explanations.
Remember that the users do not know the reports I provided.
